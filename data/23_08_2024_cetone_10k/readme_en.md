# Lactate and Ketones Test

> Note: This test aims to initiate research pathways on ketone esters. The results obtained should be interpreted accordingly and are based on a single athlete.

## Context

Intensive preparation for a marathon with a weekly training load of 150 km. On the test day, a total of 60 km had been run during the week.
The general training focused on paces of 3'10", 3'15", and 3'20". The goal was to work on endurance in the context of marathon preparation, without specifically targeting lactate tolerance adaptation for the paces performed during the test.
**Weather conditions**: High temperature (~32 degrees Celsius) with 4% wind resistance measured by a Stryd sensor.

### Athlete Information

- **MAS**: 23 km/h
- **Height**: 176 cm
- **Weight**: 63 kg
- **VO2max**: 76 ml/min/kg
- Not specifically trained for the paces achieved during the session, as in the final preparation phase for the marathon with a high mileage volume.

## Protocol

### Lactate Protocol and Measures

Last meal consumed at 9 am before the effort:

- A gel containing 30g of carbohydrates without caffeine, consumed 15 minutes before the first series of exercises.
- A similar gel accompanied by 25g of ketone ester (i.e., 50 ml), consumed 15 minutes before the second series of exercises.

## Results

A notable gain in terms of recovery was observed, with a rapid reduction in lactate levels to a very low value of **2.5** in just 15 minutes. Additionally, an increase in lactate levels was noted during the second series of exercises, suggesting that supplementation with ketone esters might have raised lactate levels, possibly by increasing anaerobic energy contribution.

Ketone ester supplementation also seemed to lower the heart rate by **3%**, which could indicate improved cardiovascular efficiency.

Regarding power (W), no significant improvement was observed, but there was also no degradation in performance. Despite a 15-minute recovery phase, which is relatively long in physiological terms as it can disrupt the effort dynamics, it remains too short for complete recovery.

## Conclusion

The lactate and ketones test revealed several important insights in the context of intensive marathon preparation:

1. **Improved Recovery**: Lactate levels decreased rapidly to a very low value of **2.5** in just 15 minutes, indicating efficient recovery.
2. **Impact of Ketone Supplementation**: Ketone ester supplementation seemed to increase lactate levels during the second series of exercises, suggesting higher anaerobic energy contribution. Additionally, this supplementation resulted in a **3%** reduction in heart rate, potentially indicative of better cardiovascular efficiency.
3. **Maintained Power**: No significant gain in terms of power was observed, but it is also important to note that there was no degradation in performance despite the 15-minute recovery phase. While this phase is sufficient to disrupt the physiological effort dynamics, it was not long enough for complete recovery.

In conclusion, the results suggest that ketone ester supplementation can offer significant benefits in terms of recovery and cardiovascular efficiency, while maintaining constant power output. It would be pertinent to continue the research to optimize recovery duration and evaluate the impact of ketones on various performance parameters. These parameters include marathon paces at 3'15 per kilometer, as well as high threshold paces of 3'10 per kilometer, corresponding to the athleteâ€™s typical training paces.

The hypothesis is that ketones could lead to a lower lactate rate at these paces.
